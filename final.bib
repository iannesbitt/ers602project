abstract = {Across the plate boundary zone in south central Alaska, tectonic strain rates are high in a region that includes large glaciers undergoing wastage (glacier retreat and thinning) and surges. For the coastal region between the Bering and Malaspina Glaciers, the average ice mass thickness changes between 1995 and 2000 range from 1 to 5 m/year. These ice changes caused solid Earth displacements in our study region with predicted values of -10 to 50 mm in the vertical and predicted horizontal displacements of 0-10 mm at variable orientations. Relative to stable North America, observed horizontal rates of tectonic deformation range from 10 to 40 mm/year to the north-northwest and the predicted tectonic uplift rates range from approximately 0 mm/year near the Gulf of Alaska coast to 12 mm/year further inland. The ice mass changes between 1995 and 2000 resulted in discernible changes in the Global Positioning System (GPS) measured station positions of one site (ISLE) located adjacent to the Bagley Ice Valley and at one site, DON, located south of the Bering Glacier terminus. In addition to modifying the surface displacements rates, we evaluated the influence ice changes during the Bering glacier surge cycle had on the background seismic rate. We found an increase in the number of earthquakes (ML≥2.5) and seismic rate associated with ice thinning and a decrease in the number of earthquakes and seismic rate associated with ice thickening. These results support the hypothesis that ice mass changes can modulate the background seismic rate. During the last century, wastage of the coastal glaciers in the Icy Bay and Malaspina region indicates thinning of hundreds of meters and in areas of major retreat, maximum losses of ice thickness approaching 1 km. Between the 1899 Yakataga and Yakutat earthquakes (Mw=8.1, 8.1) and prior to the 1979 St. Elias earthquake (Ms=7.2), the plate interface below Icy Bay was locked and tectonic strain accumulated. We used estimated ice mass change during the 1899-1979 time period to calculate the change in the fault stability margin (FSM) prior to the 1979 St. Elias earthquake. Our results suggest that a cumulative decrease in the fault stability margin at seismogenic depths, due to ice wastage over 80 years, was large, up to ∼2 MPa. Ice wastage would promote thrust faulting in events such as the 1979 earthquake and subsequent aftershocks.},

abstract = {Apatite (U-Th)/He dating from the St. Elias orogen in southern Alaska illustrates a potential association between long-term denudation and glacier sliding. Cooling ages as young as 0.4 Ma (exhumation {\~{}}4-5 mm/yr) are concentrated in a narrow band near the glacier equilibrium line altitude (ELA) front, where mean Quaternary ELA intersects the windward flank of the orogen. This band of denudation is not correlated with individual faults, structural trends, or known concentrations of precipitation, and we propose that it is produced by focused glacier sliding at or near the ELA front. This implies that long-term glacial erosion is a maximum at ELA, which corroborates model predictions that glaciers and climate can control the pattern of crust removal from orogens. Denudation rates do not covary with fluctuations in glacier size along the ELA front, suggesting that small glaciers are capable of keeping pace with incision by larger ones and tectonic rock uplift. Ice discharge may thus play a critical, but complex, role in excavating glaciated orogens.},

abstract = {We present a two-dimensional velocity model to constrain crustal thickness and composition of the Yakutat terrane in the northern Gulf of Alaska. The model was constructed using seismic reflection and refraction data along a {\&}{\#}8764;455 km onshore-offshore profile. Our model shows that the crystalline crust composing the Yakutat terrane is wedge-shaped, with crustal thickness increasing west to east from {\&}{\#}8764;15 km to {\&}{\#}8764;30 km. Crustal velocity and structure are continuous across the terrane, with lower crustal velocities {\textgreater}7 km/s, suggesting that the Yakutat terrane is an oceanic plateau across its entire offshore extent rather than a composite oceanic-continental terrane as previously proposed. The thickest Yakutat crust is entering the adjacent St. Elias orogen where elevated exhumation rates and concentrated seismicity in this vicinity are likely influenced by incipient Yakutat-North America collision. Our model includes a {\&}{\#}8764;8 km thick low-velocity crustal cap extending across the eastern portion of the profile where shallow basement is imaged on marine seismic reflection data. We interpret this cap as a lithified, metamorphosed remnant accretionary prism, providing evidence of a previous attempt at Yakutat subduction along its eastern margin prior to current emplacement at the southern Alaska margin.},

New lowtemperature cooling ages from this area, the glaciated Chugach-St. Elias Mountains, constrain long-term (10 6 yr) exhumation rates. Vertically averaged exhumation rates reach ;3 mm/yr, but are an order of magnitude lower than rates based on short-term sediment yields. Whereas these exhumation rates are not exceptional for orogenic belts, denudation patterns are strongly correlated with the distribution of glaciers, and erosion appears to keep pace with convergence and uplift. These findings imply a coupling between glacially dominated erosion and tectonics.},

abstract = {CryoSat-2 radar altimeter data have been applied to map surface elevations of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, and of Arctic icecaps. In this article we investigate the feasibility of using CryoSat-2 data for spatiotemporal analysis of surface elevation of a large mountain glacier. Bering Glacier, Alaska (which is 8–20 km wide and approximately 80 km long) is selected as a study area because it surges and hence shows short-term elevation changes. The approach includes a correction method, geostatistical analysis, and several methods for error assessment. A time series of digital elevation models (DEMs) is derived for six-month increments from Summer 2011 to Winter 2013/2014. DEMs have, on average, numerical Kriging errors of 1.65 + 3.19 m and Kriging estimation standard deviations of 11.32 + 1.01 m. A crossover analysis with airborne laser altimeter data from the fall months of 2011, 2012, and 2013 produced differences of 5.03 + 13.67 m compared to respective CryoSat-2 data sets. Difference maps are derived from the DEMs and are used to infer dynamical changes associated with the recent surge. In conclusion, CryoSat-2 data can be employed for spatiotemporal mapping of the evolution of surface elevation in Bering Glacier and other mountain glaciers of similar width, while providing key insight into large-scale elevation change over relatively short time periods.},

abstract = {Outlet streams of Variegated Glacier, Alaska, U.S.A., were observed before, during and after the surge of 1982–83. Measurements of discharge, suspended sediment and dissolved load in the outlet streams are presented for the years 1982–84, and comparisons are made with data from previous years. The data are interpreted to yield characteristics of the basal hydraulic system. The surging region of the glacier was underlain by a basal hydraulic zone of low water velocity and high water storage, inferred to be a distributed-flow system. The ice down-glacier of the propagating surge front was underlain by a high-velocity, low-storage zone, inferred to be a conduit system. The volume of water stored above the surge front was the major hydraulic control on the surge. Basal bedrock erosion during the surge was extreme in comparison to non-surging glaciers. The sediment output was directly proportional to the basal sliding, with a dimensionless erosion rate (meters eroded from the bed divided by meters of sliding) of order 1.0 × 10 −4 . Total erosion during the 20 year surge cycle was on the order of 0.3 m of bedrock, with approximately two-thirds occurring during the 2 years of the surge peak, and the bulk of this during the peak 2 months.},

abstract = {A finite element model for ice sheets has been modified to include an accounting of basal melt water. The calculated amount of basal water is used to find the velocity of ice sliding over the bed. The interplay of the basal water and sliding velocity is investigated by a series of modeling experiments. Simulations of the interception, growth, and de-glaciation of the Northern Hemisphere are considered. The simulations are driven with a climate controlled by the GRIP ice core data. The experiments contrast a number of different mechanisms for relating the amount of basal water and the sliding velocity. The mechanisms range from no sliding whatsoever, to a scheme in which the sliding velocity is proportional to the amount of basal water. The modeled results demonstrate that choice of sliding mechanism has a dramatic effect on the glaciation cycle. Furthermore, modeling results indicate that the sliding velocity must be related to the basal water depth to correctly simulate a complete glacial cycle. The relation is important to inception and all other phases of a glacial cycle. The volume of the ice at the last glacial maximum can be compared to the estimated sea level rise to further constrain the new modeling approaches. {\textcopyright} 2002 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

abstract = {Early theories of plate tectonics assumed plates were rigid with deformation limited to within a few tens of kilometers of the plate boundary. However, observations indicate most continental plates defy such rigid behavior with deformation extending over 1000 kilometers inboard. We construct three-dimensional (3D) numerical models of the boundary between the Pacific and North American plates in Alaska to investigate the relative controls of flat slab subduction, continental scale faulting, and a non-linear rheology on deformation in the overriding plate. The models incorporate a realistic slab shape based on seismicity and seismic tomography and a variable thermal structure for both the subducting and overriding plates based on geologic and geophysical observables. The inclusion of the Denali fault in the models allows for the portion of south-central Alaska between the Denali fault and the trench to partially decouple from the rest of North America, forming an independently moving region that correlates to what has been described from geologic and geodetic studies as the Wrangell block. The motion of the Wrangell block tracks the motion of the flat slab in the subsurface indicating the subducting plate is driving the motion of the Wrangell block. Models using a composite (Newtonian and non-Newtonian) viscosity predict compressional motion along the northern bend in the Denali fault, consistent with thermochronologic data that show significant late Neogene exhumation in the central Alaska Range, including at Mt. McKinley, the tallest mountain in North America. These 3D numerical models of the Pacific-North American margin in Alaska show the subducting slab is the main driver of overriding plate deformation in south-central Alaska and combined with the Denali fault can reproduce several first order tectonic features of the region including the motion of the Wrangell block, uplift in the central Alaska Range, subsidence in the Cook Inlet-Susitna Basins, and upwelling at the slab edge beneath the Wrangell volcanics. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.},

abstract = {Until recently, published rates of incision of bedrock valleys came from indirect dating of incised surfaces. A small but growing literature based on direct measurement reports short-term bedrock lowering at geologically unsustainable rates. We report observations of bedrock lowering from erosion pins monitored over 1–7 yr in 10 valleys that cut indurated volcanic and sedimentary rocks in Washington, Oregon, California, and Taiwan. Most of these channels have historically been stripped of sediment. Their bedrock is exposed to bed-load abrasion, plucking, and seasonal wetting and drying that comminutes hard, intact rock into plates or equant fragments that are removed by higher flows. Consequent incision rates are proportional to the square of rock tensile strength, in agreement with experimental results of others. Measured rates up to centimeters per year far exceed regional long-term erosion-rate estimates, even for apparently minor sediment-transport rates. Cultural artifacts on adjoining strath terraces in Washington and Taiwan indicate at least several decades of lowering at these extreme rates. Lacking sediment cover, lithologies at these sites lower at rates that far exceed long-term rock-uplift rates. This rate disparity makes it unlikely that the long profiles of these rivers are directly adjusted to either bedrock hardness or rock-uplift rate in the manner predicted by the stream power law, despite the observation that their profiles are well fit by power-law plots of drainage area vs. slope. We hypothesize that the threshold of motion of a thin sediment mantle, rather than bedrock hardness or rock-uplift rate, controls channel slope in weak bedrock lithologies with tensile strengths below ∼3–5 MPa. To illustrate this hypothesis and to provide an alternative interpretation for power-law plots of area vs. slope, we combine Shields' threshold transport concept with measured hydraulic relationships and downstream fining rates. In contrast to fluvial reaches, none of the hundreds of erosion pins we installed in steep valleys recently scoured to bedrock by debris flows indicate any postevent fluvial lowering. These results are consistent with episodic debris flows as the primary agent of bedrock lowering in the steepest parts of the channel network above ∼0.03–0.10 slope.},

abstract = {Feedback among atmospheric and silicate circulation systems is dominated at the macroscale by advection/rheological relationships that influence whole lithosphere and that are relatively well characterized by current tectonic/landscape theory. At the meso- and micro-scales of faults, rivers, glaciers and coasts, however, cooperation in the coupled silicate/atmospheric system is obscured in standard landscape theory by inconsistencies inherent in the employment of multiple Earth response laws, in which the Earth model used depends on the ambient surface process regime. Here we introduce an alternative formulation for coupled tectonic and landscape evolution that unifies the description of the silicate Earth response to both tectonic and geomorphic forcings within a single framework: the Failure Earth Response Model (FERM). FERM is constructed on the two, basic assumptions about the three-dimensional stress state and rheological memory: I.) Material displacement, whether tectonic or geomorphic in origin, at or below Earth's surface, is driven by local forces overcoming local resistance, and II.) Large displacements, whether tectonic or geomorphic in origin, irreversibly alter Earth material properties enhancing a long term strain memory mapped into the topography. In addition to the gathering of stresses generated by far field tectonic processes, topography and the inertial surface processes into a single stress state for every point, FERM allows explicit consideration of the contributions to the evolving landscape of pore pressure fluctuations, seismic accelerations, and fault damage. Incorporation of these in the FERM model leads to highly heterogeneous and anisotropic stress and strength patterns, largely predictable from knowledge of mantle kinematics, that strongly couple with landscape evolution at the meso- and micro- scales. Here we focus on the FERM description of knickpoint migration to illustrate the high frequency cooperation among tectonic, slope, and fluvial processes in the evolution of actively deforming orogens.},

abstract = {In southern Alaska, the Pacific plate and Yakutat terrane subduct beneath the North American plate along the Aleutian Trench and Pamplona zone, respectively, and are sliding past each other at minimal rates along the Transition fault. As the deformation front of the Pamplona zone stepped eastward during the Pliocene–Pleistocene, the Pacific–North American–Yakutat triple junction became unstable. Four recent seismic images reveal that the Transition fault changes from a single strike-slip boundary east of the deformation front to three strands that step increasingly seaward between the deformation front and the Aleutian Trench. The southern two strands deform the Pacific crust, and the outermost of these became increasingly convergent sometime since 1 Ma, as demonstrated by young growth strata. We propose that this internal deformation of the Pacific plate is an attempt to re-attain stability, which can only be reached by creating a tectonic boundary collinear with the Pamplona zone. The plate reorganization will result in initiation of subduction such that a portion of former Pacific crust will become accreted to the North American plate. Such accretion events caused by triple-junction instability may be an important mechanism for transferring oceanic crust to continental margins.},

abstract = {Numerical experiments are used to investigate the thermo-mechanical controls for inducing flat subduction and why flat subduction is rare relative to normal/steep subduction. Our modeling results demonstrate that flat subduction is an end-member of a steady state subduction geometry and is characterized by a curved slab with a nearly-horizontal slab section. Intermediate cases between normal/steep and flat subduction appear to be transient in origin and evolve toward one of the stable end-members. Physical parameters inducing flat subduction can be classified into four categories: buoyancy of the subducting oceanic lithosphere (e.g., slab age, oceanic crustal thickness), viscous coupling between the overriding and downgoing plates (e.g., initial subduction angle), external kinematic conditions, and rheological properties of the subduction zone. On the basis of parameter sensitivity tests and the main characteristics of present-day flat subduction zones, positive buoyancy from either the young slab or the thickened oceanic crust is considered as the primary controlling parameter. Our results show that the possibility of flat subduction is directly proportional to oceanic crustal thickness and inversely proportional to the slab age. Furthermore, oceanic crust must be thicker than 8 km to induce flat subduction, when the slab is older than 30 Ma with an initial subduction angle of ≥ 20{\"{i}}¿½ and without absolute trenchward motion of the overriding plate. The lower the initial subduction angle or the thicker the overriding continental lithosphere, the more likelihood for flat subduction. The initial subduction angle is more influential for the development of flat subduction than the overriding lithospheric thickness, and a thick overriding lithosphere induces flat subduction only under the condition of an initial subduction angle of ≤ 25{\"{i}}¿½, with a slab age of ≥ 30 Ma and without absolute trenchward motion of the overriding plate. However, when the initial subduction angle is increased to {\textgreater} 25{\"{i}}¿½, no flat subduction is predicted. All the parameters are evaluated within the constraints of a mechanical framework in which the slab geometry is regarded as a result of a balance between the gravitational and hydrodynamic torques. Any factor that can sufficiently reduce gravitational torque or increase hydrodynamic torque will exert a strong effect on flat subduction development. Our results are consistent with the observations of modern flat subduction zones on Earth.},

abstract = {Ongoing oblique collision and flat-slab subduction of the Yakutat terrane has produced Earth's highest coastal mountain range, the Chugach–St. Elias orogen in Southeast Alaska. Massive glaciers and ice fields cause extensive erosion, but also limit access to rocks that allow detailed study of the orogen. Fission track and U/Pb dating of detrital zircon from glacial rivers reveal the exhumation history of the Chugach–St. Elias orogen. Orogenic development started ca. 30 Ma and pulses of exhumation occurred 20 ± 2 Ma and 11 ± 2 Ma. Differential exhumation occurred across major fault zones and the locus of exhumation shifted southward. The ca. 5 Ma cooling ages of detrital zircon in the Pliocene–Pleistocene Yakataga Formation reveal that source rock exhumation was likely associated with faulting along the ice-covered Fairweather fault–Contact fault system.},

Analog and numerical models have shown variations in tectonic regime induced by slab folding over the 660 km depth discontinuity zone in orthogonal convergence. Here using a three-dimensional model of oblique subduction (30°) and accounting for free top surfaces, we show how slab folding generates an along-strike slab dip segmentation, inducing variations in topography of the overriding plate. When the subducting plate begins to curve forward, the elevation height rises inland and varies along the trench from 5 km to 2 km. The Andes are a suitable natural zone to compare our results with because of its linear margin and well-constrained plates kinematics. Thus, we provide a new explanation to the general decrease in elevation from the central to southern Andes, which still remains to be combined with other 3-D mechanisms to explain the actual Andean topography.},

To the east, deformation associated with the Queen Charlotte-Fairweather fault system is extending offshore, facilitating westward propagation of strike-slip motion along the eastern segment of the Transition fault. To the west, the oblique-slip Pamplona zone and Transition faults merge at an embayment in the continental margin, where a north-south dextral strike-slip fault within the Pacific plate, illuminated by the 1987-1992 earthquake swarm, intersects the Pacific-Yakutat tectonic boundary. These fault patterns are consistent with modern plate motions and reflect a plate boundary reorganization that may be caused by resistance to subduction by the Yakutat block, a possible moderate-sized oceanic plateau.},

abstract = {Modern shelf bathymetry bordering the Gulf of Alaska exhibits shelf-crossing sea valleys that suggest focused pathways for ice flow during glacial conditions. Using an integrated seismic data set between the present Yakutat and Alsek Sea Valleys, we investigate the glacial stratigraphic record in order to improve our understanding of the regional glacial system during maximum glacial conditions. Our investigations reveal four glacial unconformities, of which, the latter two are overlain by sediment packages hundreds of meters thick. We suggest that these unconformities are indicative of ice advance phases during the Little Ice Age (LIA), the Last Glacial Maxima (LGM), and two pre-LGM advances with glacial retreat sequences preserved from the youngest two. The advances were dominated by ice expanse from the Malaspina Glacial system and Alsek River districts rather than the Hubbard Glacial system and only show distinctive morainal bank development near the shelf edge and near the mouth of, or within, modern bays, fjords, or river valleys. This observation strongly supports rapid and continuous retreat from glacial maxima conditions during climatic warming. All, except the inferred LIA sequence, transgress the shelf and exhibit concentrated erosion in overdeepened troughs, analogous to cross-shelf troughs similar to those observed on other high-latitude glaciated shelves. The two Alaskan troughs discussed here may be end-member examples of high-sediment flux systems due to the temperate glacial setting combined with an actively exhuming orogen.},

Incorporating realistic glacier sliding laws and spatial variations in rock resistance, our simulations illustrate how ice flow, erosion patterns and topography interact in the long term evolution of glacial landforms. In addition, our results indicate for the first time that the formation of a steady-state U-shaped valley takes approximately 105 years.},

@article{Sklar2001,
abstract = {Recent theoretical investigations suggest that the rate of river incision into bedrock depends nonlinearly on sediment supply, challenging the common assumption that incision rate is simply proportional to stream power. Our measurements from laboratory abrasion mills support the hypothesis that sediment promotes erosion at low supply rates by providing tools for abrasion, but inhibits erosion at high supply rates by burying underlying bedrock beneath transient deposits. Maximum erosion rates occur at a critical level of coarse-grained sediment supply where the bedrock is only partially exposed. Fine-grained sediments provide poor abrasive tools for lowering bedrock river beds because they tend to travel in suspension. Experiments also reveal that rock resistance to fluvial erosion scales with the square of rock tensile strength. Our results suggest that spatial and temporal variations in the extent of bedrock exposure provide incising rivers with a previously unrecognized degree of freedom in adjusting to changes in rock uplift rate and climate. Furthermore, we conclude that the grain size distribution of sediment supplied by hillslopes to the channel network is a fundamental control on bedrock channel gradients and topographic relief.},

High-resolution seismic data indicate that 3.2 × 10 8 m 3 of sediment has accumulated in Columbia Fjord over the past three decades, which corresponds to {\~{}}5 mm a −1 of erosion averaged over the glaciated area. We develop a general model to infer the sediment-flux history from the glacier that is compatible with the observed retreat history, and the thickness and architecture of the fjord sediment deposits. Results reveal a fivefold increase in sediment flux from 1997 to 2000, which is not correlated with concurrent changes in ice flux or retreat rate. We suggest the flux increase resulted from an increase in the sediment transport capacity of the subglacial hydraulic system due to the retreat-related steepening of the glacier surface over a known subglacial deep basin. Because variations in subglacial sediment storage can impact glacial sediment flux, in addition to changes in climate, erosion rate and glacier dynamics, the interpretation of climatic changes based on the sediment record is more complex than generally assumed.},

Critical shear stress and kd are used to define the erosion resistance of the streambed. The jet-testing apparatus applies hydraulic stresses to the bed and the resulting scour due to the impinging jet is related to the excess stress parameters. Streams tested were primarily silt-bedded in texture with low densities, which is typical of loess soils. Results indicate that there is a wide variation in the erosion resistance of streambeds, spanning six orders of magnitude for $\tau$c and four orders of magnitude for kd. Erosion resistance was observed to vary within a streambed, from streambed to streambed, and from region to region. An example of the diversity of materials within a river system is the Yalobusha River Basin in Mississippi. The median value of $\tau$c for the two primary bed materials, Naheola and Porters Creek Clay Formations, was 1.31 and 256 Pa, respectively. Streambeds composed of the Naheola Formation are readily eroded over the entire range of shear stresses, whereas only the deepest flows generate boundary stresses great enough to erode streambeds composed of the Porters Creek Clay Formation. Therefore, assessing material resistance and location is essential in classifying and modelling streambed erosion processes of these streams.},

abstract = {Erosion, sediment production, and routing on a tectonically active continental margin reflect both tectonic and climatic processes; partitioning the relative importance of these processes remains controversial. Gulf of Alaska contains a preserved sedimentary record of the Yakutat Terrane collision with North America. Because tectonic convergence in the coastal St. Elias orogen has been roughly constant for 6 My, variations in its eroded sediments preserved in the offshore Surveyor Fan constrain a budget of tectonic material influx, erosion, and sediment output. Seismically imaged sediment volumes calibrated with chronologies derived from Integrated Ocean Drilling Program boreholes show that erosion accelerated in response to Northern Hemisphere glacial intensification (∼2.7 Ma) and that the 900-km-long Surveyor Channel inception appears to correlate with this event. However, tectonic influx exceeded integrated sediment efflux over the interval 2.8–1.2 Ma. Volumetric erosion accelerated following the onset of quasi-periodic (∼100-ky) glacial cycles in the mid-Pleistocene climate transition (1.2–0.7 Ma). Since then, erosion and transport of material out of the orogen has outpaced tectonic influx by 50–80{\%}. Such a rapid net mass loss explains apparent increases in exhumation rates inferred onshore from exposure dates and mapped out-of-sequence fault patterns. The 1.2-My mass budget imbalance must relax back toward equilibrium in balance with tectonic influx over the timescale of orogenic wedge response (millions of years). The St. Elias Range provides a key example of how active orogenic systems respond to transient mass fluxes, and of the possible influence of climate-driven erosive processes that diverge from equilibrium on the million-year scale.},

abstract = {The University of Maine Ice Sheet Model was used to study basal conditions during retreat of the Laurentide ice sheet in Maine. Within 150 km of the margin, basal melt rates average ∼5 mm a −1 during retreat. They decline over the next 100 km, so areas of frozen bed develop in northern Maine during retreat. By integrating the melt rate over the drainage area typically subtended by an esker, we obtained a discharge at the margin of {\~{}}1.2 m 3 s -1 . While such a discharge could have moved the material in the Katahdin esker, it was likely too low to build the esker in the time available. Additional water from the glacier surface was required. Temperature gradients in the basal ice increase rapidly with distance from the margin. By conducting upward into the ice all of the additional viscous heat produced by any perturbation that increases the depth of flow in a flat conduit in a distributed drainage system, these gradients inhibit the formation of sharply arched conduits in which an esker can form. This may explain why eskers commonly seem to form near the margin and are typically segmented, with later segments overlapping onto earlier ones.},

abstract = {The measurement of glacier velocity fields using repeat satellite imagery has become a standard method of cryospheric research. However, the reliable discovery of important glacier velocity variations on a large scale from noisy time-series of such data is still problematic. In this study we propose a new post-processing procedure for assembling a set of velocity fields in time-series that generates a better visualization of glacier speed changes when the velocity fields are sparse or noisy. We demonstrate this automatic method on a large glacier area in Alaska/Canada. The visualization tool provides an overview of where and when interesting glacier dynamics are occurring. The goal is not to improve accuracy or precision, but the timing and location of ice flow events such as glacier surges. Building upon existing glacier velocity products from the GoLIVE data set (https://nsidc.org/data/golive), we compile a multi-temporal stack of velocity data over the Saint Elias Mountain range and vicinity. Each layer has a time separation of 32 days, making it possible to observe details such as within-season velocity change over an area of roughly 600{\&}thinsp;000{\&}thinsp;km2. Our methodology is robust as it is based upon a fuzzy voting scheme to filter multiple outliers. The multi-temporal data stack is then smoothed to facilitate interpretation. This results in a spatio-temporal dataset where one can identify short-term glacier dynamics on a regional scale. Our implementation is fully automatic and the approach is independent of geographical area or satellite system used. Within the Saint Elias and Kluane mountain ranges, several surges and their propagation characteristics are identified and tracked through time, as well as more complicated dynamics in the Wrangell's mountains.},

abstract = {Numerical models are used commonly to study the topographic evolution of glacially eroded landscapes. These models are grounded on a power-law rule that relates bedrock erosion rate to either the sliding speed or discharge of glaciers. This rule, however, is poorly linked to the principal process of glacial erosion, quarrying, in which bedrock blocks are dislodged from the bed by sliding ice. A new model of quarrying allows this erosion rule to be evaluated. As in past quarrying models, ice-bed separation during sliding controls deviatoric stresses in the rock that cause crack growth. Unlike past models, bedrock strength heterogeneity resulting from preglacial fractures is included using a Weibull statistical distribution of rock strength. This strength distribution is predicated on the observation that larger rock bodies have lower strengths because they have a greater probability of containing a large fracture. Results can, indeed, be closely fitted with a power-law erosion rule, but its nonlinearity, the range of sliding speed over which it applies, and erosion rates depend sensitively on bedrock strength heterogeneity and effective pressure. This theory anchors large-scale models of glacial erosion to the primary small-scale process that these models hope to simulate and reinforces recent emphasis on the role of bedrock fractures in accelerating geomorphic processes. Moreover, by linking basal water pressure to erosion rate, the theory can improve efforts with numerical models to study feedbacks between subglacial hydrology and landscape evolution.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Geological Society of America. We provide model evidence for a previously unexplored positive feedback between tectonic strain and fluvial erosion by considering rock erodibility as a function of shear damage. Plastic shear strain permanently damages the upper crust within planar shear zones, providing a greater ease for detachment and transport by fluvial processes. The subsequent rapid erosion of exposed shear zones reforms the topographic stress field in a way that encourages continued accommodation of strain, a positive feedback response that becomes more prominent with greater shear damage. Based on model results and natural examples, rock strength heterogeneity plays a major role in the evolution of drainage network patterns and the capability for valley-scale strain localization in active orogens.},

abstract = {Frequency-magnitude relationships are determined for a source region defined by a circular epicentral area of 50 km radius centered on the Carnegie broadband seismograph at KMU in the southeast corner of Hokkaido Island, Japan. Within this region, bounded by a maximum depth of 125 km, more than 11,100 earthquakes were detected and cataloged by the Hokkaido University network during the period July 1976 through January 1987. The seismicity is divided into two effectively decoupled suites: crustal (Eurasian plate) and subduction (Pacific plate). The frequency-magnitude recurrence distributions exhibit departures from linearity which are statistically significant below md = 2.5 for the crustal data suite and md = 3.5 for the subduction data suite. Three independent tests show the nonlinearity is not caused by incompleteness; the catalog is complete down to magnitude 2.0 or less for both data suites. These observations are therefore inconsistent with the linear Gutenberg-Richter relationship, which is assumed to be valid over any magnitude range for which the data are complete. There are relatively more large events and fewer small events in the subduction suite. The logarithm of the ratio of the number of crustal events to the number of subduction events versus magnitude is monotonically decreasing and remarkably linear over the magnitude range 1.0 to 5.0. This suggests that the observed nonlinearity of these two frequency-magnitude relationships has a common origin.},

abstract = {Previous studies in the Yakataga fold-thrust belt of the St. Elias orogen in southern Alaska have demonstrated high exhumation rates associated with alpine glaciation; however, these studies were conducted with only a rudimentary treatment of the actual structures responsible for the deformation that produced long-term uplift. We present results of detailed geologic mapping in two corridors across the onshore fold-thrust system: the Duktoth River transect just west of Cape Yakataga and the Icy Bay transect in the Mount St. Elias region. In the Duktoth transect, we recognize older, approximately east-west–trending structures that are overprinted by open, northwest-trending fold systems, which we correlate to a system of northeast-trending, out-of-sequence, probably active thrusts. These younger structures overprint a fold-thrust stack that is characterized by variable structural complexity related to detachment folding along coal-bearing horizons and duplexing within Eocene strata. In the Icy Bay transect, we recognize a similar structural style, but a different kinematic history that is constrained by an angular unconformity at the base of the syntectonic Yakataga Formation. At high structural levels, near the suture, structures show a consistent northwest trend, but fold-thrust systems rotate to east-west to northeast trends in successively younger structures within the Yakataga Formation. We present balanced cross sections for each of these transects where we project the top of basement from offshore seismic data and assume a subsurface structure with duplex systems similar to, but simplified from, structures observed in the onshore transects. These sections can account for 150–200 km of shortening within the fold-thrust system, which is {\textless}33{\%} of the likely convergence based on the subsurface geometry of the subducted Yakutat terrane lithosphere. This mismatch with known convergence is the result of loss of the earliest thrust belt structures by erosion and recycling into the orogen, sediment subduction, and three-dimensional (3D) motions that move mass through the cross section. Based on order of magnitude estimates and regional geophysical studies, we suggest that sediment subduction has been significant and probably accounts for previously recognized low Vp/Vs (compressional to shear wave velocity) ratios in the mantle wedge above subducting Yakutat lithosphere. Our section restorations also provide a simple explanation for the observed elongate bullseye pattern of low-temperature cooling ages in the thrust belt as a consequence of exhumation above the growing duplex and/or antiformal stack. Comparison with analog model studies suggests that structural feedbacks between erosion and development of d{\'{e}}collement horizons in coal-bearing strata led to this structural style. Although previous studies based on thermochronology suggested an active backthrust at the northern edge of the thrust belt, section restorations indicate that a backthrust is allowable but not required by available data. The Yakataga fold-thrust belt has been treated as a dominantly 2D system, yet our work indicates that 3D processes are prominent. In the Duktoth transect, we interpret a group of northeast-trending thrusts as younger, out-of-sequence structures formed in response to the rapid destruction of the orogenic wedge by glacial erosion and deposition immediately offshore. We infer that these northeast-trending thrusts transfer slip downdip into a duplex system that forms the antiformal stack modeled in cross-section restorations, and we infer that these structures represent thrusting stepping back from the active thrust front attempting to rebuild an orogenic wedge that is being destroyed as rapidly as, or more rapidly than, it is being rebuilt. In the Icy Bay transect, we use the relative chronology provided by an angular unconformity beneath the syntectonic Yakataga Formation to infer that early, northwest-trending fold-thrust systems were formed along the Fairweather transform as transpressional structures. Continued strike slip carried these structures into the tectonic corner between the Fairweather and Yakataga segments of the orogen, producing a counterclockwise rotation of the shortening axis until the rocks reached their present position.},

abstract = {A principal assumption of models that describe bedrock quarrying by glaciers is that cracks in the bed are small and isolated. These cracks are assumed to grow slowly in response to glacial loading to eventually delimit the areas of quarried surfaces. If this assumption is correct, then quarried-surface orientations will be controlled by orientations of principal stresses in the bed associated with sliding and resultant ice-bed separation downglacier from rock ledges and roches moutonn{\'{e}}es, rather than by orientations of joints that predate glacial loading. To test this hypothesis, we compared orientations of quarried surfaces and preglacial joints in nine recently deglaciated forefields of glaciers in Canada and Switzerland with different bedrock lithologies and bedforms. In all but one forefield, quarried surfaces and major joint sets are coincident, with orientations of quarried surfaces bearing no systematic relationship to sliding direction other than their obvious tendency to not face upglacier. A difference in sliding direction of 64° between two areas of one glacier forefield had no effect on the orientation of quarried surfaces, with the same joint set exploited in both areas. These observations motivate a new characterization of subglacial bedrock that differs from that of existing quarrying models. The bed is idealized as a group of rock blocks separated by preglacial joints. Slow crack growth necessary for quarrying would be confined to small bodies of rock (bridges) that connect the faces of joints. This model of the bed does not allow it to be treated as an intact elastic solid with hydraulically isolated cracks as is usually assumed, which would have a profound influence on characterization of quarrying mechanics. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

What is not known is how well$\backslash$nthis sliding history is reflected in the sediment output from a glacier$\backslash$nand to what degree temporary sediment storage in the glacier smoothes$\backslash$nthe history of sediment production. We document sediment evacuation$\backslash$nrates for three seasons at Bench Glacier, a small temperate alpine$\backslash$nglacier in the Chugach Range of Alaska. Two lines of evidence suggest$\backslash$nthat subglacial sediment storage is small. Strong hysteresis in the$\backslash$nrelationship between sediment and water discharge argues for sediment$\backslash$nexhaustion from the subglacial system on seasonal and flood event$\backslash$ntimescales. Uplift of the glacier surface during periods of enhanced$\backslash$nbasal motion reflects intimate contact of the glacier sole with up-glacier-inclined$\backslash$nstoss slopes of bedrock bumps. Sediment evacuation rates at Bench$\backslash$nGlacier should therefore closely track glacial erosion rates over$\backslash$nannual timescales. Much of the sediment emerges in a major pulse$\backslash$nthat closely follows the termination of enhanced sliding each year,$\backslash$nsuggesting that the conduits and well-connected cavities that allowed$\backslash$nremoval of englacial water to terminate sliding also promoted efficient$\backslash$ntransport of sediment.

(ITI) from airborne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) data acquired 4–13 September 2000, (ii) the German Aerospace Center (DRL) from spaceborne InSAR data acquired by the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) 11–22 February 2000, and (iii) the US Geological Survey (USGS) from aerial photographs acquired in 1972/73, were differenced to estimate glacier surface elevation changes from 1972 to 2000. Spatially non-uniform thickening, 10 ± 7 m on average, is observed on Bagley Ice Valley (accumulation area) while non-uniform thinning, 47 ± 5 m on average, is observed on the glaciers of the Malaspina complex (mostly ablation area). Even larger thinning is observed on the retreating tidewater Tyndall Glacier. These changes have resulted from increased temperature and precipitation associated with climate warming, and rapid tidewater retreat.},
